# Investigating Bias in Online Movie Ratings

This project explores potential **biases and inflation** in online movie rating systems, focusing on patterns that may influence consumer trust and decision-making. 

Inspired by data journalist [**Walt Hickey's in-depth analysis**](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/) on rating manipulation published in 2015, the analysis examines historical and recent movie ratings to uncover trends to assess the prevalence of systemic rounding practices and inflated scores. Key concerns include the near absence of low ratings, a disproportionate concentration of scores above four stars, and the potential for commercial platforms to benefit from higher perceived movie quality. 

Given the film industryâ€™s substantial economic impact and the influence online ratings wield over audience choices, evaluating the integrity of these systems is essential. The analysis aims to shed light on how these biases may persist or have evolved over time, ultimately contributing to a more transparent and trustworthy ratings ecosystem.


### Why should we care?
Understanding the integrity of online movie ratings is crucial for several reasons:

- The film industry is a significant economic force, generating billions annually at the U.S. box office. Consequently, the influence of **online ratings aggregators** on consumer decisions is substantial.
- Fandango, as a prominent player in the movie ticketing market, has a **vested interest** in shaping consumer perceptions through its ratings. Their influence extends to direct ticket sales.
- Regulatory bodies such as the **Federal Trade Commission** are vigilant in safeguarding consumers against deceptive and anti-competitive practices. Monitoring the online rating ecosystem for transparency and accountability is essential in ensuring **fair and transparent marketplace practices**.

Building upon Hickey's findings, this project seeks to assess whether Fandango has implemented measures to address these biases as previously indicated, or if the observed patterns continue to persist within their rating system. The goal is to contribute to a more transparent and accountable rating ecosystem, empowering consumers and regulatory bodies to make informed decisions.


### Finding Suitable Datasets
The analysis two distinct datasets for our investigation. This approach allows for the comparison of Fandango's ratings both before and after Walt Hickey's influential 2015 analysis:

- **The 2015 Dataset**: We'll begin by examining the dataset originally collected by Walt Hickey as part of his comprehensive analysis. The dataset, fandango_score_comparison.csv, provides a snapshot of Fandango's rating practices before potential adjustments made in response to Hickey's findings.

- **The 2016-2017 Dataset**: In addition to Hickey's dataset, we'll also incorporate a dataset spanning the years 2016 to 2017. This dataset provides a more recent perspective on Fandango's ratings landscape, allowing us to assess whether any changes or adjustments have occurred following Hickey's analysis.
