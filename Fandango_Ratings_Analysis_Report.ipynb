    "# Investigating the Biasness in Online Movie Ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we delve into the question of whether online movie rating aggregators exhibit bias and dishonesty in their ratings. Our focus is on a detailed examination of Fandango's data, prompted by suspicions raised by data journalist [Walt Hickey's investigation](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/) in 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hickey's analysis uncovered concerning patterns within Fandango's rating system. Specifically, his findings revealed that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ratings were consistently rounded up to the nearest half-star, with no instances of rounding down.\n",
    "- Remarkably, almost no movie received a rating lower than three stars (98% of the time). Furthermore, 75% of the ratings were at least four stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project aims to extend this investigation further by analyzing whether Fandango has addressed these biases as promised or if the observed patterns persist in their rating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why should we care?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the integrity of online movie ratings is crucial for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The film industry is a ***significant economic force***, generating billions annually at the U.S. box office. Consequently, the influence of online ratings aggregators on ***consumer decisions*** is substantial.\n",
    "- Fandango, as a prominent player in the movie ticketing market, has a ***vested interest*** in shaping consumer perceptions through its ratings. Their influence extends to direct ticket sales.\n",
    "- Regulatory bodies such as the ***Federal Trade Commission*** are vigilant in safeguarding consumers against deceptive and anti-competitive practices. Monitoring the use of ratings and endorsements is essential in ensuring ***fair and transparent marketplace practices.***\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this investigation, we aim to contribute to a more transparent and accountable online rating ecosystem, empowering consumers and regulatory bodies to make informed decisions."
